                When I started I had low expectations, I thought: more video tutorials Suddenly I found myself with step-by-step guided lessons, 100% practical exercises, and all the information updated to 2021. If you feel lost you can request help from SkyVirt team on telegram. You do not need to install operating systems or hardware, you have simulators in real-time. Real infrastructure on the fly (hardware when you need it) also if you do not have experience in cloud or terminals, in this program you acquire it immediately. The quality of the laboratories and exercises are Aws, Azure, and Google cloud platform the best in the market (You will learn about advanced Cyber Security, cloud infrastructure + control tools for the development of the software) and all the real-life hands-on labs you're going to develop Upon completion of the certification, you will be able to apply for a job, with a great advantage and if you have already basic knowledge, you will gain more experience in Cyber Security. You can't find this kind of information and exercises from real life on the internet, yet. I recommend it 100%.
